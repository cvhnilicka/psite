        Climbing is a relatively new addition to my life as I have only been climbing for about a year, however, it still deserves a shout out when I try to present a holistic view on 'Me.' 
        Like most other kids, I always enjoyed climbing trees, mounds of dirt, the house, etc. However, as I entered high school and focused on other sports,
        my interest in ascending seemed to take a backseat. It was not until the later half of my time at college that climbing began to enter my life again.

        During my fourth year of college, I moved in with a buddy of mine who was really starting to get into climbing (more specifically boulding). He was the one 
        that introduced me to a very special movie, Valley Uprising, that would become a very important part of my life. I didn't start to physically start climbing 
        till about six months after college, but Valley Uprising would remain an escape for me during the stressful late nights of studying. For some reason, as long
        as I had that movie playing, I was able to put all of the stress of work, school, and relationships behind me.

        Now fast forward a couple months after graduating. I am 'living' in my car traveling west to a new job and the next chapter in my life. While in Joshua tree,
        I began to physically climbing the boulders and absolutely fell in love with it. The challenge that clmbing presented was addicting from the start, and all I
        could think about was getting healthier and better so that I could climb better. And so began my love affair with climbing.

        Much like Valley Uprising, climbing presents me with an environment where I can completely shut out stressers of my life and focus on the problem at hand. 
        The puzzle-like nature of each route demands your attention to succeed.
